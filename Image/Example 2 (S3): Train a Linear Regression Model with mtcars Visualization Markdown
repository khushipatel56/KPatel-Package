## Steps and Code for Training a Model

1. **Load Necessary Libraries**:
    - The `KPatel` and `ggplot2` libraries are loaded to access the model training functionality and plotting capabilities.
  
    ```{r setup, include=FALSE}
    library(KPatel)
    library(ggplot2)
    ```

2. **Display Initial Dataset and Summary**:
    - The initial dataset (`mtcars`) and a summary of its features are shown to understand the data.
    
    ```{r}
    head(mtcars)
    summary(mtcars)
    ```

3. **Train the Model**:
    - The `train_model` function from the `KPatel` package is used to train a linear regression model (`lm_model`) on the `mpg` (miles per gallon) variable, using the rest of the features in the `mtcars` dataset.
    
    ```{r}
    lm_model <- train_model(
      formula = mpg ~ .,
      data = mtcars,
      method = "lm" # Other options might include "rf", "svmLinear", etc.
    )
    ```

4. **Display the Model Summary**:
    - The summary of the final linear regression model is shown to examine the model's performance and coefficients.
    
    ```{r}
    summary(lm_model@model$finalModel)
    ```

5. **Make Predictions on the Training Data**:
    - Predictions are made on the `mtcars` dataset using the trained model.
    
    ```{r}
    predictions <- predict(lm_model, newdata = mtcars)
    ```

6. **Combine Actual and Predicted Values**:
    - A new data frame `results` is created, combining the actual `mpg` values with the predicted ones.
    
    ```{r}
    results <- data.frame(
      Actual = mtcars$mpg,
      Predicted = predictions
    )
    ```

7. **Plot Actual vs Predicted Values**:
    - A scatter plot is created to visualize how well the predicted `mpg` values compare to the actual ones. A reference line (`y = x`) is added to show the ideal relationship between actual and predicted values.
    
    ```{r}
    ggplot(results, aes(x = Actual, y = Predicted)) +
      geom_point(color = "blue", size = 3) +
      geom_abline(slope = 1, intercept = 0, linetype = "dashed", color = "red") +
      labs(
        title = "Actual vs Predicted MPG",
        x = "Actual MPG",
        y = "Predicted MPG"
      ) +
      theme_minimal()
    ```
